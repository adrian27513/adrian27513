## 🔬 My Research  

### Muharaf: Manuscripts of Handwritten Arabic Dataset for Cursive Text Recognition  
Mehreen Saeed, ***Adrian Chan***, Anupam Mijar, Joseph Moukarzel, Georges Habchi, Carlos Younes, Amin Elias, Chau-Wai Wong, Akram Khater

**Published at:** Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (**NeurIPS**), Sep 26, 2024  
📄 **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09630)** | 💾 **[GitHub](https://github.com/mehreenmehreen/muharaf)** | 📂 **[Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/11492215)**  

#### 🔍 Abstract  
We present **Muharaf**, a dataset of **1,600+ historic handwritten Arabic page images** transcribed by experts.  
Each document includes **polygonal coordinates** for text lines and essential page elements.  
This dataset enhances **handwritten text recognition (HTR)**, particularly for cursive scripts.  
It spans **varied handwriting styles** and document types, including **letters, diaries, legal correspondences,** and **church records**.  
We describe the **data acquisition pipeline**, dataset features, and **preliminary CNN-based baseline results**.

How Long Do Model Patches Last? A Temporal Perspective on PortLLM
**Adrian Chan**, Abigail Woodring, Rana Shahroz, Sukwon Yun, Tianlong Chen, Chau-Wai Wong
**Under Review at:** International Conference on Learning Representations (**ICLR**)  

#### 🔍 Abstract  
As LLMs undergo continual pretraining, the **temporal reliability of downstream fine-tuning methods becomes increasingly important**. Using **PortLLM-style patches** as a baseline, we find that patching shows a **statistically significant performance decline over time**, even when the task and architecture remain unchanged.

We propose a **forecasting algorithm** that estimates **failure dates** and tests hypotheses about target-date performance failures. These methods rely only on historical performance indicators, enabling developers to **anticipate patch degradation** and make **cost-effective decisions about retraining**.

### HATFormer: Historic Handwritten Arabic Text Recognition with Transformers
***Adrian Chan***, Anupam Mijar, Mehreen Saeed, Chau-Wai Wong, Akram Khater

**Under Review at:** International Conference for Machine Learning (**ICML**)  
📄 **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02179)** | 💾 **[GitHub](https://zenodo.org/records/14165756)**  

#### 🔍 Abstract  
Handwritten Arabic text recognition (**HTR**) is **challenging** due to **varied writing styles** and **limited dataset availability**.  
We propose **HATFormer**, a **transformer-based encoder-decoder model** adapted from a state-of-the-art English HTR model.  
HATFormer:  
- Leverages **attention mechanisms** to capture **spatial contextual information**.  
- Addresses **cursive character differentiation**, **visual decomposition**, and **diacritic recognition**.  
- Uses **custom Arabic text tokenization** and an **optimized image processor** for Arabic handwriting.  

**Performance Highlights:**  
- **8.6% Character Error Rate (CER)** on the largest **historical** Arabic HTR dataset (**51% improvement** over baselines).  
- **4.2% CER** on the largest **non-historical** Arabic HTR dataset.  
- Demonstrates **adaptability of English HTR methods** to **low-resource languages** with **script-specific challenges**.
